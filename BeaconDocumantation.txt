Estimote Beacon 

Testing App TestRun 1
  Beacon varied on when they were being detected
  The beacon that ware closer to the phone had higher priority than the further beacon
  Detecting beacon from outside ware not that reliable compare to inside
  Its takes a while for the phone to detect the beacon

Testing App TestRun2 stripmall simulator
  Beacons that are further away can be detected two to three meter ahead of the beacon or in some cases in front of the beacon
  Beacons that were closer together were being detected half of meter past the beacon or in some cases in front of the beacons
  If walking outermost of the sidewalk beacon were being detected two to three meter ahead of the beacon or in some cases in front of the beacons
  If walking innermost of the sidewalk beacon were being detected in front of the beacon or half of meter ahead or pass the beacons

Testing App TestRun 3 open field
  In general beacon were very inconsistent when being detected
  When you are closer to the beacon (when walking) they were being detected from half of a meter to a meter past the beacon in some case were not being detected
  When further away from the beacon (when walking) this is where it was being inconsistent in some cases they were being detected about a meter or further ahead and past the beacon on other cases not even being detected by the device

Beacon In General
  Once you detect beacon their no way a phone can navigate to it
  Beacon to beacon detection is very accurate
  You can get the 3D position of the beacon but not that accurate
  Older beacon don't work with the nwer Estimote SDK depending what maleware you have
